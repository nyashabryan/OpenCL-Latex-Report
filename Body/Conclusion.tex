\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, for each image, speed up increases with an increse in number of partions i.e which coicides with the number of threads spawn until a certain threshold. Any increase in number of threads above the threshold results in a reduction in speed. Also, it can be concluded that allocating data partions sequentially is faster than allocating data randomly.
