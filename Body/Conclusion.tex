\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Speed-Up}

\subsection{Transfer Overhead}

It can be concluded that the transfer overhead is caused by OpenCL Execution Model.The host CPU has to discover available compute devices in the system, define programs to run those compute devices, buffers that are used for communicate between the host program and program on the compute devices and to queue work. For this experiment, the transfer overhead is directly proportional to the matrix size, N.
\\
When the overhead is not included into account, the average speed up was found to be 12.8 which is higher than average speed up obtained in part 1.
